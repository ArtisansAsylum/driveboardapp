MinimalDriveboard
=================

Here you will find instructions on how to build a minimal Driveboard with an Arduino Uno. Compared to a regular Driveboard this requires more wiring and also lacks some features. In any case this may be a good starting point to build your CNC machine from the ground up. the following shows a 2-axis setup as it is used by the [Lasersaur](http://www.lasersaur.com). A 3-axis setup is also possible but left as an exercise for the reader.



### Required Parts:
- Arduino Uno
- 2 Setpper Drivers
- 2 Stepper Motors
- 4 Limit Switches
- 1 Door Switch
- 1 E-Valve
- 1 Big AC Switch
- 24V PSU
- 5V PSU


### Work in Progress ....
